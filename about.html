    <p>This is a collection of Hypertext Transfer Protocol response status codes.
        Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server.
        It includes codes from IETF Request for Comments, other specifications,
        and some additional codes used in some common applications of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
        The first digit of the status code specifies one of five types of responses,
        listed under the <code><a class="embed" href="codeindex.html">Index</a></code> tab.
        The codes shown are typical, but may be replaced with human language alternatives with or without the actual code
        (Ex. <code><a class="embed" href="codes/4xx/404.html">404 Not Found</a></code>).</p>
    <p>This site is meant to provide relevant information on various codes that a server may return during
    online testing, or debugging of a website.</p>
